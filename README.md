## About This Project

I implemented this project in the context of a course at [profy.dev](https://profy.dev/). This course mimics a professional real-world development environment.

Designs were provided via [Figma](https://figma.com/). The project was split into small tasks using [ClickUp](https://app.clickup.com/) as a project management tool. I created a pull request for every task. The code was reviewed line by line by [Johannes](https://jkettmann.com/), a senior developer.

In this project I have been exposed to many practical techniques that I wouldn't have learned otherwise. For example:

* **Creating pixel-perfect designs**
* **Planning and implementing a complex UI component**
* **Implementing data fetching with error handling**
* **Debugging inside an IDE**
* **Writing integration tests**
* **Professional Git workflow with pull requests**
* **Code reviews**
* **Continuous integration**

I was free to choose any technical stack, packages, and coding styles to finish the project as long as I met the acceptance criteria of each given task. The only limitation was to use React and styled-components.

The code reviews gave me insights into best practices to follow. I was able to learn a lot and evolve my front-end knowledge rapidly.
